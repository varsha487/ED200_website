        <h1>Our Mission</h1>

        <p>
          At Edgemont Academy, our mission is to provide an education that is
          rigorous, interdisciplinary, and grounded in real-world application.
          We believe that learning should empower students to think critically,
          engage thoughtfully with their communities, and navigate an increasingly
          complex global society.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our curriculum is intentionally designed to move beyond traditional
          subjects. By integrating the humanities, sciences, mathematics,
          and practical life skills, we encourage students to see connections
          between disciplines and apply their knowledge in meaningful ways. We also
          prioritize social justice and equity, ensuring that our students
          understand diverse perspectives and are prepared to contribute to
          a more just and inclusive world.
        </p>

        <p>
          We place a strong emphasis on civic engagement, global awareness,
          and personal responsibility. Through coursework that addresses
          current events, ethical questions, and real-world challenges,
          students develop the skills necessary to become informed,
          compassionate, and active participants in society. We do not just aim for 
          benchmarks in our courses and hope the students take away more than just
          a grade. Additionally, our courses are meant to prepare students for 
          whatever they decide to pursue after high school, whether that be college,
          a career, or any other path they choose. This is why our courses focus on 
          life skills and themes in addition to traditional curriculum.
